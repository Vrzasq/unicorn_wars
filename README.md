* Left click or touch to stop direction indicator in direction which You want to shot

Here is couple ideas how i want to progress further with the game :

* add whether affect which will affect bullet physic like wind or gravity change - randomized every turn
* add background
* change bullet sprite to something more in game spirit ;)
* change direction indicator to be more intuitive
* p2p multiplayer
* damage animation
* play against AI
* play without borders
* play without roof
* play without indicators
* rapid fire mode
* friendly fire mode
* extra bouncy mode
* power ups
* different levels environment which will affect bullet physic:
--* underwater level
--* space level
* large level with following camera
* platform level
* more playable characters
* player tint

Feedback is appreciated.
